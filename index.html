  <header> HAPPY BIRTHDAY </header>
  
  <p> Congratulations on making it this  far - you are officially...still my younger sister, but old enough to adopt me. Flashback to grade 8,
  when we first met and started bonding over Alan Walker (Yeah remember THAT era??)...and did I mention through Google Chats? Because thats a thing! Flashback to Gr9 when the main friend group was still being formed, and you started becoming an edgy teenager - then grade 10...grade 11...and now - you aren't grade 12 anymore, you are now an elderly woman with a determination to tackle life and it's problems by the ankle, because, as tall as you are, you are indeed still short. You are an incredibly hardworking, intelligent and morally upright individual and I am more than proud to call you my sister - if you had given me the option to completely take you as my sibling, I would - any day of the week. Thank you for always being there for me when I needed someone, to tell someone about my random dreams, my random issues and philosophical ideas. I hope that I can be there for you in that capacity for many years to come - you are a blessing to everyone around you, and especially to me. You are the best person that anyone could ever call their sister, and i hope that no matter what you will always be treated as the amazing person you are - with the compassion and the care which you show others. And i hope that you never forget the positive impact you have had on others, you have changed many lives, including mine, in an incredibly positive manner. We (my symbiote and I) love you to the ends of the Earth and back. Stay safe, stay in school and don't do drugs...or other way around. You'll always  have your older brother to look out for you. - Love, Your Big Brother</p>
